# kotlin-coroutines-example
The main goal of coroutines is to "simplify asynchronous work by getting rid of callbacks." Coroutines are NOT threads. I like to think of coroutines as JOBS. And each "job" may contain "child jobs". Jobs that can run in any thread. Many coroutines can run in a single thread at once.
